Hello! :milky_way: I am Tolga. Most of these repositories are related to my class assignments, including geospatial data analysis, feature space exploration, testing various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms using Python and R. 
Additionally, you may find some experimental things :rocket: :robot: :world_map: inspired by my personal interests.
